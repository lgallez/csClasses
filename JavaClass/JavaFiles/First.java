// Highlevel language is something like java - don't have to write a lot like you would with assembly. 
// Assembly you would have to write a lot more to do the same program. Assembly only works with the computer it's written on.
 // Class is the object in object oriented 

// Procedure oriented language is like C++. C++ uses int instead of class. -no class
